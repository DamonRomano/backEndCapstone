*Moto Bene* is my final capstone project for the six-month, full-time, full-stack, Nashville Software School developer bootcamp.

Among my friends, I am the car guy. I built *Moto Bene* as a first step in addressing the perennial question, "What car should I buy?".  

[Edmunds.com](edmunds.com) offers a "[car finder](http://www.edmunds.com/finder/car-finder-results.html)" as part of their site. It is searchable/filterable by criteria that matter to regular folks: number of seats, fuel economy, towing capacity, cost of ownership. And there's nothing wrong with that.  Good and valuable service. On the other hand, mainstream automotive magazines perform instrumented performance tests of new car models. They aggregate the data but don't publish it.
Neither provides a database of cars searchable by criteria that matter to people who care about driving.

*Moto Bene* is aimed at driving enthusiasts. Want to filter for cars that have at least 400 horsepower?  We got it. Want to see only the cars that can be had with a manual transmission?  Can do. Torque? 0-60mph acceleration times? Check and check.

It's a simple app; one that I hope to build out further as time permits. It's a passion project for me: I love cars and I love learning.
